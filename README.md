# RC4-Decryption-Circuit
This repository contains the code for a fully implemented RC4 Decryption Circuit using FPGA. The circuit is designed and implemented on the DE2 board. The main goal of this project is to study digital circuits that make extensive use of on-chip memory and to implement RC4 decryption and cracking circuits.
